So thrilled to share that I am now in Beijing, Chinaüìç and start my intern in the multi-agent group of [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University!

It's exciting to explore a new topic on utilizing a multi-model or multi-agent setting on alignment problems and work with fantastic collaborators. Please feel free to drop me a message if you are interested in this topic and would like to discuss! 

Tsinghua University was covered in snow on my first day here. Moreover, I fortunately attended the Multimodal Intelligence seminar held on 20th Dec at FIT building:

Thanks for the recognition from THUNLP group. I believe this journey will be quite enjoyable!
